# fix me and things to do...
aka observations about how to get this working ! 

# issues


# todo 

## general
### use menu to reduce parameters
things like polyphony can be implemented as context menu
however, this requires using custom json



-----------------------------------------------------

## module - eigenHarp 
### EigenLite
move to using floats, so that things like breath can be bipolar, and also have calibrations



### fix module to one eigenharp?
this implies EigenLite filter will allow ANY,1
currently this would link to both first base and pico.

not sure, without eigenlite api change we do this AND allow no filter

-----------------------------------------------------
## module - scaler 



-----------------------------------------------------


# module - split 
### voicing
we will want to re-voice for each split.


-----------------------------------------------------

# module - function 
looks at 4 keys, and generate gate if true
... we may want to specify trig/gate/toggle as output
(per output)

toggle is useful for when selecting rigs/keygroups
gate is a momentary switch
trig cause actions e.g. increase/decrease octave


-----------------------------------------------------

# module - switch 
very simlar to Split but switch between groups... based on selector



-----------------------------------------------------

# Meta Morph

### Goal
The purpose of Meta Morph is to allow all Eigenharp models to be used within VCVRack (Free and Pro),without any additional software or install.


## Motivation
The key motivation was providing a 'platform' for the Eigenharps that is modern, and well supported - yet extremely flexible.
also, due to low latency and high data bandwidth of the Eigenharp it was important we could do this all at audio rate.
VCV Rack was a perfect fit for this... and opens exciting new ways to use the Eigenharp.

furthermore, I wanted to provide a route that means other developers can add 'eigenharp' functionality to VCV without needing to understand a complex codebase.
to this end, I have documented the wire protocol, I use between meta morph modules to allow for this.





### Credits:
Id like to thank the following, without thier help this would not be possible.
- Ben Norland for work on the panel design, and also the meta morph logo.
- EigenLabs for embracing open source, making this possible
- VCVRack for having an open api, with a GPL policy 

and of course, users who provide valueable feedback, making this better than I can alone.

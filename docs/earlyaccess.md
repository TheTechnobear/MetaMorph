# Overview
Meta Morph is an open source project featuring vcv rack modules to use with your Eigenharp.


inital release will be macOs only (arm and intel)


# Early Access

Meta Morph is being released into Early Access to give the community an opportunity to improve Meta Morph before release.

it will focus on: 
- testing 
- development of demo/tutorial patches
- development of user documentation
- development of preset patches


by definition there's limited documentation etc and may be bugs, or known issues, so its not for everyone :) 
the aim is to ensure that when released new users will have a good experience, by sorting this out with a dedicated group of users.
the other aim is to (hopefully) reduce efforts in these areas on my part, and so allow me to focus on development.


I should also stress whilst changes and new features may be added during EA, this is NOT its primary goal.
It's focus is to get what we already have ready for general release.


How EA users can contribute?


### testing
In this role, if you gave issues you will need to provide a **simple** patch that illustrates the issue.
the simpler the better.. I dont have time to go thru massive patches that are not working, you'll need to 'isolate' the problem.
we will need to est 


### develop demo/tutorial patches
we will want to co-ordinate this so we cover a broad base.
Im not after very complicated patches, rather patches that will show new users how to use modules.
There simplicity also will help with the testing aspect (see above)


### improve user documentation
my documentation will be a bit sparse initialy, it would be useful for new users to read these, and start expanding on them.
new users are ideal for this, as they are a blank canvas, so know what needs to be documented.


### development of preset patches
This will be in the LATER part of the EA program, when the modules are considered mature (unlikely to change).
Here we want a couple of more complex patches for each Eigenharp, that new users can use as a 'starting point'
unlike the tutorial patches, these to do aim to teach, so complexity is not a problem.
e.g. the Factory presets for EigenD are useful to all EigenD users, but they are not easy to understand/modify.
but bare in mind , the purpose of using VCV w/ Meta Morph is to 



## Important notes on patches
This must **only** use VCV Factory Modules (and Meta Morph) so that any user can install VCV and use without installing any other modules.
this is very important support and and first impressions.
we will also have a means to share more advanced patches before users... but they are not considered part of the EA program.


The final important aspect of being part of EA is by helping contribute the above, you will gain knowledge in Meta Morph, its goals and how it works.
this will enable you to participate meaningfully in dicussions about how things can evolve.


None of the above needs to be particuarly time-consuming, nor does it require any special expertise.
But I am asking for a bit more commitment, that  I'll install it, and fiddle with it for a while ... needs to be a bit more focued!



# What Early Access is NOT
It is **not** a general release for those that  want to use Meta Morph but will not 'contribute' to the project.
As you can imagine I'm very busy with development, so at this stage I want to limit my 'support' to those that will help the project.
once the EA is complete, then due to EA goals, it will be easier to support, so I can help more users.

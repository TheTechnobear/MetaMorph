# Overview

The idea of this wiki is that anyone can contribute to it, and help improve the documentation.

This means you can help document the modules, or even add tips or general information about how to use the SSP.

# What do you need to do?
- you need to have a GitHub account to edit these pages - it's free :) 
- you can then edit this pages in any browser
- anyone can edit, any page, or create pages
- editing is with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor, so easy to use.
- 'advanced editing' is available using 'markdown' , 
see tips below... but don't worry about this if you are new to it.
- there is a 'editing history' for pages, so if you make mistakes we can correct it ;) 

# Questions?
If you have any questions about how to participate, or issues then please discuss on [polyexpression.com](https://community.polyexpression.com/tag/meta-morph)

IF something happens you are unsure about, e.g. you accidentally delete a page (please don't ;) ) , then PM me (TheTechnobear) on the forum, and I can 'retrieve it' (all page edits retain a history, so can be recovered) 


# Style

Readers like to have a consistent style, so please try to maintain a similar structure for things like module pages.

Please do not just add 'random' pages, it becomes very confusing for users.
e.g. if you have a tip for a module, perhaps its better to discuss on the percussa forum, until it can 'fitted' into this wiki in a nice neat way.


## Tips

### Sub Pages
do not make individual pages too long - no-one, likes to scroll endlessly down a webpage hunting for information.
so consider using sub-pages. 
this is very easy within a wiki using : 

```
[[My Subpage title|page-name]]
```
from : 

```
[[Contributing| Contributing]]
```

we get: 

[[Contributing| Contributing]]

note: if its RED then this means the page does not exist yet, if you click on it, it will be created :) 

## Tables
Tables are useful for formatting and are really easy to create

from : 
```
|Name |Description|Author| 
|---|---|---|
|box|a box |Mark|
|circle|a cirle|Jill|
|rectangle|a rectangle|Jens|
```
we get: 

|Name |Description|Author| 
|---|---|---|
|box|a box |Mark|
|circle|a cirle|Jill|
|rectangle|a rectangle|Jens|

# Adding images
please do NOT add images from other sources as links.. the issue with this is potentially they will break in the future.

the 'correct' way to do this is to upload the image to this wiki repo (MetaMorph.wiki), 
this is a bit complicated, but is outlined nicely in [this post](https://gist.github.com/subfuzion/0d3f19c4f780a7d75ba2) 

alternatively, send me(thetechnobear) a PM on the percussa forum, and I can upload image for you.

# Contributions
bare in mind everything here is PUBLIC, so do **not** share anything that is not public information etc.
this is a standard GitHub repo, so can be cloned and copied by anyone. so everything you submit here is in the public domain.

note: whilst I (thetechnobear) do not retain any ownership over this wiki, as above its all public.
please bare in mind, Ive spent quite a few hours editing and collating information here, so please don't just go and host it somewhere else.
